The Alchemists
==============
An exploration of labor force metrics changing over time at the county level.

## Visualizations

### Single Year: Georgia 2004  
Investigate differences between counties for a single year of data. An alternative "bubble chart" is used to give
a sense of proportionality for counties that have high rates of unemployment
but have a very small population.

### Multiple years: Georgia 2004 - 2014  
Quickly see the same visualizations as the one above for the years 2004 through 2014. You can clearly see the effect of the 2008-2009 recession as the unemployment rate is color on an absolute scale.

### Compare two years: Georgia from 2004 to 2014  
Compare two years with each other directly, by taking the difference of each metric (unemployment rate, establishments and average weekly wage) and rendering the difference.
